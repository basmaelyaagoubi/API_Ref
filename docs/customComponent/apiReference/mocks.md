## Overview

The directory structure for the **Mocks** folder outlines:

1. **api.ts**
   - Contains mocked API functions or endpoints used during development and testing to simulate backend calls without the need for an actual server.

2. **lodash.ts**
   - Include mocked implementations of Lodash utilities, possibly used to ensure consistent behavior or responses during testing without relying on the actual Lodash library.

3. **useCheckboxEventsMock.ts**
   - A mock file for custom hooks related to checkbox event handling. This could be used in tests to simulate user interactions with checkbox components.

4. **useIterableParentNodeMock.ts**
   - Mocks functionalities related to a hook that manages iterable relationships within node structures, possibly used for testing components that require parent-child data context handling.

5. **useSourcesMock.ts**
   - Provides mocked implementations of a hook used for managing data sources, ensuring that components relying on external data can be tested independently of those data sources.

Each of these files serves an important role in your development process, primarily for testing purposes to isolate components and hooks from external dependencies, ensuring that they function correctly in controlled environments.
