## Welcome to Qodly

Welcome to **Qodly**, a hybrid low-code web application development platform. The Qodly platform is a fully integrated environment where you can develop, test, deploy, and monitor any web application.

### What is a low-code development platform?

To develop a web application with Qodly Studio, you will need a very small amount of code. In fact, you might sometimes need no piece of code, you just design the application and Qodly Studio creates all necessary code for you.

## What is Qodly?

The Qodly plaform is made of a **Studio**, a **Server**, and a **Cloud**, all working together flawlessly to provide you with an end-to-end software platform that can build web business apps in no time.

### Qodly Studio

4D Web Studio is a new way of building business web applications, powered by 4D. Our vision is to provide developers a 100% web-browser-based experience by allowing them to:

* design web forms visually by drag and dropping components on a canvas
* preview pages instantly
* easily map data with ORDA data classes
* directly execute 4D code on web events or datasource events
* code & debug in the browser
* and even edit a data model

At the end of the road, developers will be able to build complete web business applications using only a web browser and their 4D coding skills. There is no JavaScript involved.
