<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9312; &nbsp;</span> First, we have the mighty <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Webforms</span>, which are versatile containers where you can design the user interface of your application using drag-and-drop components like buttons, grids, and style boxes to create your desired layout.

<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9313; &nbsp;</span>  Next, we have <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Methods</span>, which are blocks of code that perform specific tasks, such as creating custom actions for buttons or manipulating data.

<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9314; &nbsp;</span>  In the <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Classes</span> section, you'll find all the data classes used in your application. These classes define the structure of your database and allow you to access and manipulate data.

<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9315; &nbsp;</span>  The <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Shared</span> section allows you to store and share resources across multiple web forms or data classes, including shared datasources that can be used in several webforms within the same project. This makes it easy to reuse functions and improve efficiency.

<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9316; &nbsp;</span>  The <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Debugger</span> is like the all-seeing eye that allows you to test your application and identify and fix any errors or issues that may arise. You can step through your code, view variables, and identify and fix any bugs in your application.

<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9317; &nbsp;</span>  In <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Roles & Privileges</span>, you can define user roles and assign privileges to them, granting you greater control over who can access sensitive information within your application.

<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>&#9318; &nbsp;</span>  Finally, the <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Model</span> editor allowing you to directly build datastore classes using JSON. Unlike traditional data modeling tools that use XML or other structured formats, our Model Editor gives you greater flexibility and control over your data model, allowing you to create complex data structures with ease.
