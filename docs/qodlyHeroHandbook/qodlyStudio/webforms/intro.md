<br />

As the creator of <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Qodly Studio</span>, I can assure you that my 100% web-based experience offers you an intuitive toolset that's just as powerful as any advanced technology. <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>QDroid</span> - your very own personal assistant - will help you design web forms effortlessly, allowing you to preview your pages instantly. With the ability to easily map data using ORDA data classes and execute <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>QodlyScript</span> code on web events or datasource events, the possibilities are endless.

<br />

The first step in <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Qodly Studio</span> is always to create a <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Webform</span>, which serves as the container for all other components. To get started, <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>&#9312;</span> simply go to the <code>Explorer</code> section and click on the plus icon next to `Webform` to give a name to your new Webform. Alternatively, <span style={{color:'#B174E5',fontWeight: 'bold'}}>&#9313;</span>  click on the `+ New` tab, and then select `Webform`.
