When you select an application from the Apps list, it opens a dedicated panel where you can perform various actions:

## View Environment Status

You have two options to check the status of every environment:

- In the `Overview`, you can see the status of each [environment](getStarted.md#environments-and-services) represented by an icon:

- Alternatively, you can click on the left-side tabs to manage your apps individually for each environment:

## Access Files via SFTP
