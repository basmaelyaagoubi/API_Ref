## Welcome to Qodly Studio

Qodly Studio is a new way of building business web applications. Our vision is to provide developers a 100% web-browser-based experience by allowing them to:

* design web forms visually by drag and dropping components on a canvas
* preview pages instantly
* directly execute QodlyScript code on web events or datasource events
* code & debug in the browser
* configure fine-tuned privileges and roles 
* edit a data model
* easily map data with ORDA dataclasses

At the end of the road, developers will be able to build complete web business applications using only a web browser and very few coding. There is no JavaScript involved.
