Development in Qodly is based upon **Qodly Studio**. 

Qodly Studio is a new way of building business web applications. Our vision is to provide developers a 100% web-browser-based experience by allowing them to:

* create and edit a data model matching your business logic
* easily map data with [ORDA](../concepts/platform.md#the-orda-concept) dataclasses
* design web forms visually by drag and dropping components on a canvas
* preview pages instantly
* directly execute QodlyScript code on web events or datasource events
* code & debug in the browser
* configure fine-tuned privileges and roles 

At the end of the road, developers will be able to build complete web business applications using only a web browser and very few coding. There is no JavaScript involved.

## Requirements

The Qodly Studio supports the following web browsers for development:

- Chrome
- Edge
- FireFox

The recommended resolution is 1920x1080.

:::info

Deployed Qodly applications run on all browsers of the market, with no specific requirements.

## Accessing Qodly Studio

As described in the [Architecture chapter](../concepts/cloud.md), access to Qodly Studio is granted to developers once they achieved a sequence of authentication steps to enter the Qodly Console.  

You directly open your application instance in Qodly Studio from Development or Staging [environments](../cloud/getStarted.md#environments-and-services) of the Qodly Console. You can:

- click on the **Studio** button in the Overview page, or
- click on the "Studio URL" in the General tab for the open environment.

For more information, see [this section](../cloud/application-management.md#go-to-qodly-studio).
