## Component Overview

The Button component serves as a fundamental element for triggering actions or events within your web application. Buttons provide a visual cue to users, prompting them to interact with your application by performing specific tasks or operations.


## Use Cases

Buttons are indispensable in a wide range of scenarios where user engagement and interaction are paramount:

- Form Submission: Utilize buttons to allow users to submit forms after providing necessary input.

- Navigation: Implement buttons to facilitate navigation between different sections or pages of your application.

- Data Manipulation: Enable users to perform operations such as adding, editing, or deleting data entries through buttons.


## Customization

Enhance the Button component to align with your application's requirements using the following customization options:

- Label: Personalize the label to offer clear instructions or guidance.

- Icon Position: Choose the position of the icon in relation to the label, allowing options for top, bottom, left, right, or even hidden for a seamless integration into your design.

## Data-Bounding

When it comes to data-binding, it's important to note that the Button component itself is not inherently data-bound. Unlike components like the DataTable that derive their content from specified datasources, the Button component primarily focuses on initiating actions and interactions within the user interface.

## Triggers and Events

The Button component can respond to various events, enabling dynamic user experiences. Events that can trigger actions within the component include:

|Event|Description|
|---|---|
|On Click| Calls for an action when the user clicks on the component. |
|On Blur| Calls for an action when the component loses focus (user clicks outside). |
|On Focus| Calls for an action when the component gains focus (user clicks on it). |
|On MouseEnter| Calls for an action when the user's mouse cursor enters the area of the component.|
|On MouseLeave| Calls for an action when the user's mouse cursor exits the area of the component.|
|On Keyup| Calls for an action when a keyboard key is released while the component is in focus|
|On KeyDown| Calls for an action when a keyboard key is pressed down while the component is in focus. |
