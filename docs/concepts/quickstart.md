4. Click **Submit**: you enter immediately the Qodly Cloud Management Console. 


## Step 2: Create your sandbox and let Qodly prepare your environment


1. Select a Template to create your sandbox application.

You have two options:


- **create a sandbox from scratch**: your sandbox will be created empty, without any code or data. But no worries, the **Welcome tour** will guide you step by step through Qodly Studio. Select the **Blank app** template,
- **create a sandbox from a sample**: your sandbox will contain the code and data of the sample application. It is very helpful to get started with examples of screens, code and data modeling.
