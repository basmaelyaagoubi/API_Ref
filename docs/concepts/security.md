Security encompasses more than risk elimination and blocking unauthorized access or unlawful disclosure of information, it covers data loss prevention and protection against destruction.

Qodly's key features to protect your data from breaches, loss and failure events include:
- **Authentication**: Qodly supports built-in and customized authentication, as well as authentication via Active Directory and LDAP.
- **Access control with a low level authorization system**: a per session, built-in user authorization system is included in Qodly, allowing you to assign different permissions and roles to users connecting to the database.
- **Data Encryption**: ensures the confidentiality of your data by encrypting tables that contain sensitive information.
- **Backup and logs**: the Qodly platform includes administration tools that verify, maintain, and backup your data and model, ensuring data integrity in case of failure, data corruption or accidental deletion.
